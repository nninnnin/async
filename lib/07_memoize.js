/**
 * Caches the results of an async function. When creating a hash to store function results against, the callback is omitted from the hash
 * and an optional hash function can be used.
 *  If no hash function is specified, the first argument is used as a hash key, which may work reasonably if it is a string or a data type
 * that converts to a distinct string. Note that objects and arrays will not behave reasonably. Neither will cases where the other
 * arguments are significant. In such cases, specify your own hash function.
 *
 * The cache of results is exposed as the memo property of the function returned by memoize.
 *
 * @param {Function} fn - The async function to proxy and cache results from.
 *
 * @param {Function} hasher - An optional function for generating a custom hash for storing results. It has all the arguments applied to it
 * apart from the callback, and must be synchronous.
 *
 * @returns a memoized version of fn
 *
 * var slow_fn = function(name, callback) {
 *     // do something
 *     callback(null, result);
 * };
 * var fn = async.memoize(slow_fn);
 *
 * // fn can now be used as if it were slow_fn
 * fn('some name', function() {
 *     // callback
 * });
