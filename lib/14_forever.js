 * Calls the asynchronous function fn with a callback parameter that allows it to call itself again, in series, indefinitely.
 * If an error is passed to the callback then errback is called with the error, and execution stops, otherwise it will never be
 * called.
 *
 * @param {Function} fn - an async function to call repeatedly. Invoked with (next).
 *
 * @param {Function} errback(optional) - when fn passes an error to it's callback, this function will be called, and execution
 * stops. Invoked with (err).
 *

 *         // it will result in this function being called again.
 *     },
 *     function(err) {
 *         // if next is called with a value in its first parameter, it will appear
 *         // in here as 'err', and execution will stop.
